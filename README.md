# ~PREFACE:
Welcome dear reader. My name is Patricio Coiti√±o, the owner of the hands redacting this README. 
With the help of Sebastian Maidana, we have put together
a piece of information to help contextualize the inner workings of this project.

# ~ACTUAL STATE:
Not working completely. Fortunately enough, most of it works as intended.

# ~INTENDED OUTCOME:
Under Holberton School Uruguay's tutelage, we were tasked to create a working clone of the C function print().
Just a bit cut from the original functionalities and outputs, I.e printing floats is not a requirement.

# ~REDACTER'S NOTES:
You, dear reader, will find that the contents of this project (Functions and documentation included) are not nigh middle quality. 
This is, of course, to be expected from two young Holbies who are just stepping into coding, programming,
teamworking, etc. By no means are we expected to keep this level of quality and we ensure you we will 
learn, work and improve over the shortcomings along the way.

# ~USAGE:
Thanks to clever machinations of Sebastian and we got to create a function that prints using a format.

# 1- Call the "_printf()" function in your code:
_printf();

# 2- Fill the arguments to print:
_printf("Hello World!");

Output:
Hello World!

# 4- But if we wish to use the main strength of this function, formats, we should write:
_printf("%s World!", greeting);

# 5- _printf reads %s as "print given (s) trying" and finds that string in the arguments of your calling. If the greeting has the value "Hello":
Hello World!

# 6- Types of formats allowed in this function are (%d), (%i), (%c), and (%s).

# 7- Returns the length of the string.

~PREFACE:
Welcome dear reader. My name is Patricio Coiti√±o, the owner of the hands redacting this README.
With the help of young fellow initiate in the coding landscape Sebastian Maidana we have put toghether
a piece of information to help contextualize the inner workings of this project.

~ACTUAL STATE:
Unfotunate and not working completely. Fortunately enough, most of it works as intended.

~INTENDED OUTCOME:
Tasked by Holberton School Uruguay's tutelage, we were tasked to create a working clone of the C function "printf()".
Just a bit cut from the original functonalities and outputs (Does not print floats).

~REDACTER'S NOTES:
You, dear reader, will find that the contents of this projet (Functions and documentation included) are not nigh middle quality.
This is, of course, to be expected from two young Holbies who are just stepping into the realm of coding, programming,
teamworking, etc. By no means we expected to keep this level of quiality and we hope, wish and enssure we will
learn, work and improve over the shortcomings along the way.

~REASONS TO READ THIS DOCUMENT:
You are a) Part of the Holberton Staff or (a1) part of the Holberton alumnae.
	b) Someone who is truly interested in learning the reasons of our code.
	c) Us from the future (Hello us! :])
	d) Not intented to read this document at all.
	(If the last case is indeed true, I encourage you to keep on reading. You are too deep in the rabbit hole after all)
